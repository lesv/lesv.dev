So, I tried to setup a [blog](/posts/hugo) [5 years ago](/posts/first), didn't follow through.
Let's try again.

Once again, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator.  This time I've chosen to
go with the [Binario](https://github.com/vimux/binario) theme.  I reviewed lots of
[Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/blog/) many cool ones, but I liked the default
styling of Binario.

I realized that I've spent the last year creating a website based on
[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) / [Knative](https://cloud.google.com/knative/) /
[Istio](https://istio.io/), [GKE Sandbox](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-sandbox-bring-defense-in-depth-to-your-pods)
([gVisor](https://gvisor.dev)) and created runtimes in seven languages without writing, so I'm
going to try and rectify that by writing about my journey.

I'm always asking myself the same questions many of you ask, hopefully, I can provide either a bit
of clarity, or at least save you some time by cutting off paths you might not wish to travel.

I've also tried to recover posts from past blogging efforts, found that somehow my blog on Blogger
is no more. :(  (very disappointed face).  Hopefully I'll find a bit more.

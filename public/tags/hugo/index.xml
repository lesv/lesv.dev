      <description>So, I tried to setup a blog 5 years ago, didn&#39;t follow through. Let&#39;s try again.
Once again, I&#39;m using Hugo, a static site generator. This time I&#39;ve chosen to go with the Binario theme. I reviewed lots of Hugo themes many cool ones, but I liked the default styling of Binario.
I realized that I&#39;ve spent the last year creating a website based on GKE / Knative / Istio, GKE Sandbox (gVisor) and created runtimes in seven languages without writing, so I&#39;m going to try and rectify that by writing about my journey.</description>

      <description>I met SPF13 last year &amp;ndash; remembered having a good chat with him and when I was thinking about my blog, I considered various options:
 Jekyll blogger  Then I remembered Hugo.
It&#39;s been a very long time since I created a blog â€“ I&#39;ve owned AngelTech.com for a very long time, but that&#39;s hosted w/o https certificates, and is a pain to move, due to locked DNS entries, so I thought I&#39;d try hosting on Github pages.</description>
